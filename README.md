# Heroes Evolved - Auto Chess combos builder tool

#### Create your own combos within a few seconds and check how powerful it with realtime buffs tracking

### Why did I made this tool?

I wanted to try all the possible combos so when I started making combos I write down each name of hero with their Team and Class in my google's keep note, but it was very time taking and not worthy because I've to write all time each combo with full name, tank, class and their buff, and even tracking all of them and checking the buff wasn't easy. Now with this tool I can create and check any combo within few seconds.

### Some combos created by this tool

# Heroes Evolved - Auto Chess combos builder tool

### Why did I made this?

Not being lazy to stick my self with one or two best combos, I love to explore all the new and possible combos. So when I started making combos, I write down each name of hero with their Team and Class in my google's keep note, but it was very time taking and not worthy because I've to write all time each combo with full name, tank, class and their buff, tracking each of all these was not easy. only easy thing is if I stick my self with one or two combos and keep playing. but I wanted to try out all the combos and see what possibles combos I can get by different heroes.


### Furstartion of switching screens
I felt frustrated when I had to write too much again and again and going to game screen then switch to keep note screen... and sometimes when I stay a bit longer on keep note, game disconnect and required relogin which was too much frustrating.
